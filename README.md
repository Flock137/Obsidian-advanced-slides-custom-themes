# Custom theme for Advanced Slides
These `.css` files are themes that I custom designed for my [Advanced Slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) - a Slideshow extension from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Code template relates to the themes will be developed soon. 
- `80s-neon-reveal.css` - Neon Cyberpunk theme, with dark purple background and multi-color, glowing-effect headers with white text. **Left-align** for bullet list is the default.
- `Obsidianite.css`- A "clone" of the theme above, but with a more "professional" look, with black text and black header, pink background. **Left-align** for bullet list is the default.

## How to use
1. Install Obsidian, then toggle 'Community Plugins'
2. In 'Community Plugins', install 'Advanced Slides'
3. After the extension got install, go to this directory: `Your_Obsidian_Vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-advanced-slides/dist/theme/`
4. Download the `.css` files into the directory above 
5. Advanced Slides would automatically recognize the scripts, you can now set the theme in the extension's setting at `Slides Setting/Theme`
